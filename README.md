DIY Printed small PCB CNC for fast Prototyping
[My image](https://github.com/Shortcircuitboards/PCB-CNC/blob/main/images/Bildschirmfoto_zu_2020-03-31_00-38-28.png)

Super cheap and completely printable mini CNC.

I had a few Parts left from an old 3D Printer which i wanted to use for a tiny CNC which i can use to mill (engrave) PCB´s and smaller parts for my micro RC Trucks.

For the Ramps I´m using a modified version of the RS-CNC Marlin code (i will upload it during the week) I connected the Spindle motor to the FAN output and modified my Start and End gcode with M106 (on) at the beginning and M107 (off) at the end.

I will also Upload a few more videos and files.

If you wanna suport me, please buy with the Links i added. These are Affilate links, so it won´t cost you more but generates Points for me that i can start other cool pojects. Thanks :-)
